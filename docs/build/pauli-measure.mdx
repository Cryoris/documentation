# Measuring in Pauli bases

In quantum mechanics, observables correspond to physical properties that can be measured.
To measure an $n$-qubit observable $O$ on a quantum computer, we first decompose it into a sum of tensor products of Pauli operators, as

$$
O = \sum_{k=1}^K \alpha_k P_k,~~ P_k \in \{I, X, Y, Z\}^{\otimes n},~~ \alpha_k \in \mathbb{C},
$$

and then compute the expectation value of each individual Pauli term. 
However, per default, many quantum computing systems only support measuring Paulis consisting of Z and I terms, 
since they are diagonal in the computational basis $\{|0\rangle, |1\rangle\}$.

Measuring arbitrary Pauli terms therefore requires a change of basis to diagonalize them. To do this, we perform the following transformations,

$$
\begin{aligned}
    X &\rightarrow Z = H X H \\
    Y &\rightarrow Z = H S^\dagger Y S H,
\end{aligned}
$$

where $H$ is the Hadmard gate and $S = \sqrt{Z}$ is sometimes referred to as the phase gate. 
If you are using an `Estimator` to compute expectation values, the basis transformations are automatically performed.

Below is an example demonstrating how to prepare a quantum circuit and manually measure the qubits it in the X, Y, and Z bases:

```python
from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit

# create a circuit, where we would like to measure
# q0 in the X basis, q1 in the Y basis and q2 in the Z basis
circuit = QuantumCircuit(3)
circuit.ry(0.8, 0)
circuit.cx(0, 1)
circuit.cx(1, 2)

# diagonalize X with the Hadamard gate 
circuit.h(0)

# diagonalize Y with Hadamard as S^\dagger
circuit.h(1)
circuit.sdg(1)

# the Z basis is the default, no action required here

# measure all qubits
circuit.measure_all()
```
